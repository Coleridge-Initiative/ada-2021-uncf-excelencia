# Applied Data Analytics Program - UNCF / Excelencia Class
There was a 2021 Applied Data Analytics workshop for UNCF / Excelencia. Participants worked in teams with data from National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics and the Institute for Research on innovation and Science. The specific focus of the workshop was on an effort to increase data-based research capacity among institutions of higher education that serve a large share of Black and Latinx students. Participants received training on core data concepts such as record linkage and data visualization as well as cutting-edge training in machine learning.
